<h2 id="2019-11-10"><a href="#2019-11-10" class="headerlink" title="2019-11-10"></a>2019-11-10</h2><p>&emsp;&emsp;It is my first essay.<br>&emsp;&emsp;At first, I am proud to introduce the software called Grammarly to help me to fix my grammar false. It is so wonderful. And then, I want to start to write some English essay to help me improve my English.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Recently, I realized the importance of learning English. So, I attended TMC(the Toastmasters Club) and read an English novel called <em>Tuesdays with Morrie</em>. It was so funny. I can see a new world in my eyes and learned a new way to see the world. There are times when I think it is important to learn English for youngers. I want to start writing English essays from now on to record some things about my life. That so interesting.</p>
<h2 id="2019-11-17-Some-thoughts-about-this-week"><a href="#2019-11-17-Some-thoughts-about-this-week" class="headerlink" title="2019-11-17 Some thoughts about this week"></a>2019-11-17 Some thoughts about this week</h2><p>&emsp;&emsp;It was a terrible week.<br>&emsp;&emsp;This week has arisen a lot of things. I think it was terrible.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The first thing was about my job. My leader asked me to deploy the WeChat Mini Program. But I have no idea of it. I asked some colleagues about how to deploy it, but their advice was not usable. If you ask me to code, it was no problem. But to deploy was so hard. It was so dark because I don’t know about the logic of background.  We big trouble with the union is false. I even know about it. The official documents talked to me it belonged to the background. That was so absurd and make me a headache.<br>&emsp;&emsp;I took part in the Toastmasters Club was I said in last weekend. But the week I went there, I was so afraid and nerved to make a statement in public. I want to give up the club because I was not good to speak immediately. So I thought to practice writing at first. I hope it will so useful.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The final thing had some warming. Yesterday I went to Changping to meet my friends. We talk about lots of things about the job, marriage, family and life. My Big Brother ‘Song’ told me some stories about himself. It was helpful for me. In my mind, I think everyone has some good time and some unlucky time. We can’t choose it and had to accept it. He agreed with me thinking. He told me the important was your mentality and the way to deal it. It was great and so right. We got the unify of own intellectual. The other friends joked we liked the brothers have lost many years. He also told me about the attitude of marriage that the man should have independent minds. And have the right way to deal with the trouble in love. Don’t be losing your mind. I was so thanked for him to talk about the word to me.</p>
<h2 id="2019-11-24"><a href="#2019-11-24" class="headerlink" title="2019-11-24"></a>2019-11-24</h2><p>&emsp;&emsp;This week was boring.<br>&emsp;&emsp;This week is nothing to talk. And the weather was so cool. Winter is coming.<br>&emsp;&emsp;I want to buy a new computer. But I thought some things about my incoming. I will pay for my rent in January. That so pity. I have to save money to pay my rent.<br>&emsp;&emsp;I think I should find time to deal with the essays to one file, That will be convenient to read. Ok, I will do it. See you last week.</p>
<h2 id="2019-12-01"><a href="#2019-12-01" class="headerlink" title="2019-12-01"></a>2019-12-01</h2><p>&emsp;&emsp;It is the last month of the year.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The time is fast. Return this year has a lot of things had happened. I learned a lot of things in my though. Took about love, make some good friends, change a job, and the others.  There is an old saying in China is the big year is not spend. We call this is cross the robbery. Yes, I am. I lost love but I don’t regret. I lost my job but I can see the truth in the sociology. I learned to take more care with my parents and always took the phone on them. It is the truth change and I am very happy to append it. Maybe the time can make the person grow up.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Recently, I want to read a book about Steve Jobs. I’ve read it before, but I want to read it again. So I find the English version on the web. Maybe can give me a new view about him. I like his minimalist thought and his some other thoughts. Like everyone should learn the program. It is important to change your ways to face the life. So I did. I think it is useful for me. And it can help me to deal with the problems in my life. Not just literally.<br>&emsp;&emsp;I learning alone to spend my life. And I am starting to make some plans. Life should not be disordered. I don’t want to abandon my life. I should find lots of things which is interesting to me and to finish. Life is more than work and should have the others. That is call life.</p>
<h2 id="2019-12-07"><a href="#2019-12-07" class="headerlink" title="2019-12-07"></a>2019-12-07</h2><p>&emsp;&emsp;All the gifts given by fate have already marked the price in secret<br>&emsp;&emsp;I love this words. It is amazing. Actually, It is a good portrayal of life. It is from my best friend Yue. Maybe I find the best reply of myself.<br>&emsp;&emsp;This week is boring and some interesting. I try to build some frame of Vue and add some new idea in my Github. I had a lot of thoughts about the lift and work. This was so useful.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Just that.</p>
<h2 id="2019-12-15"><a href="#2019-12-15" class="headerlink" title="2019-12-15"></a>2019-12-15</h2><p>&emsp;&emsp;Everyone wants to be Sherlock, but finally, everyone to be Waston.<br>&emsp;&emsp;In fact, I really like this novel and the movies. But we always lost the eyes to find the trues. Because we just see the part in the event. Yesterday, on the way to meet my friend, I thought this thing. Everyone has their mind but just this circle. We can’t just this circle unless the other person told the new visual. That so poor. So that everyone should lifelong learning. That is impossible.</p>
<h2 id="2019-12-23"><a href="#2019-12-23" class="headerlink" title="2019-12-23"></a>2019-12-23</h2><p>&emsp;&emsp;I took part in the Graduate Entrance Exam this week. But I just joined in the English text. It not good and not bad. The reading was not bad but the translation and writing were so bad.  I think I should practice it.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Yesterday, I remember two words, just ‘Church’ and ‘tax’. The first word I didn’t know so I can’t translate the word, then I find the meaning is the ‘a service conducted in a house of worship’ and ‘one of the groups of Christians who have their own beliefs and forms of worship’. But I didn’t awake to it. I just remember ‘the Earth is the centre of the university’. And the tax is like ‘taxi’, but when I read the article I gradual know the true meaning.<br>&emsp;&emsp;It starts at countdown. So I should make a plan to face it. In fact, I just want to learn some things about deep learning. I like it. It is charming.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Good luck for me.</p>
<h2 id="2019-12-29"><a href="#2019-12-29" class="headerlink" title="2019-12-29"></a>2019-12-29</h2><p>&emsp;&emsp;I bound to addiction to LOGO. It is amazing and wonderful. I like it. So I bought a toy called Batman series yesterday. It is a car. And so cool. It was my new year gift.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The other gift is a CD by Jay Chou —— November’s Chopin. I love this CD. It can take me back the time when I first time to know about CD and pop music.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The new year will come. I want the new year will not too bad like this year. I want to find a desirable job. Maybe I will back to my town and live with my parents. It is hard to say. But I still keep my curiosity and wish to face the new year. Maybe I will meet a girl. It is hard to say.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Wish me luck.</p>
<h2 id="2020-01-05"><a href="#2020-01-05" class="headerlink" title="2020-01-05"></a>2020-01-05</h2><p>&emsp;&emsp;At first, happy new year.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Today, I went to join a club made by my friend was about deep learning. I was so shocked because the members were so outstanding and excellent.<br>&emsp;&emsp;And yesterday I learned a lot of things from my roommate was about the thought to built SQL system. And we told until one clock. So I should take some times to finish it.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Just that.</p>
<h2 id="2020-01-12"><a href="#2020-01-12" class="headerlink" title="2020-01-12"></a>2020-01-12</h2><p>&emsp;&emsp;At first, I finished the SQL sentence. It took about two hours. It is terrible for me because of the logic in SQL.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Let’s talk about bad things which the money. Yesterday I met my college friend and talked about some things with the job and money. I was embarrassed to talk about this topic because I haven’t saved some money. Looking back on these two years, my income was always kept in around 7500 yuan. In other words, I haven’t progress. I should replay it and find the place where the problem.</p>
<h2 id="2020-01-18"><a href="#2020-01-18" class="headerlink" title="2020-01-18"></a>2020-01-18</h2><p>&emsp;&emsp;Life is inspired and boring. We can’t turn the normal life too fast because it has a lot of things need to find. But we can find some things interesting.<br>&emsp;&emsp;I think it is impossible to replay your life. You can return your life and found some things about true or false and can make you impress or progress. But the important things is how to find it and how to change the false which you made. if you compromise yourself it must fail.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Maybe I should stop to update the essay. I am so poor to express myself. I should precipitation myself to think of some things.</p>
